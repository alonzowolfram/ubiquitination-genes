# README
This repository contains the code used for the paper "[**A gene signature consisting of ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinating enzymes of SKP2 is associated with clinical outcome in breast cancer.**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-06451-w)" (*Scientific Reports* 12, 2478 [2022].) The main file is the R Notebook file `skp2_ubiquitination_gene_signature.Rmd`.

The code was written for R 3.6.3 and is not guaranteed to run on other versions of R. Please note that there are two files, `rankMatrix.txt` and `brca_tcga_rnaseq2.rds` that are necessary for completing some of the analyses; these are not available on this GitHub repository due to filesize limitations. They will be made available via Dropbox shortly.
