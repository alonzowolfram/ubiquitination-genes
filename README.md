# README
This is the R Notebook containing the code used for the paper "A gene signature consisting of ubiquitin ligases and deubiquitinating enzymes of SKP2 is associated with clinical outcome in breast cancer." (Scientific Reports 12, 2478 [2022].) 

The code was written for R 3.6.3 and is not guaranteed to run on other versions of R. Please note that there are two files, `rankMatrix.txt` and `brca_tcga_rnaseq2.rds` that are necessary for completing some of the analyses; these are not available on this GitHub repository due to filesize limitations. They will be made available via Dropbox shortly.
